    Manages a pool of TensorRT execution contexts for efficient, thread-safe,
    and asynchronous inference.

    This class is designed to handle inference requests from multiple threads by maintaining
    a queue of execution contexts. This avoids the overhead of creating a new context
    for each inference call. It uses TensorRT's zero-copy mechanism by directly binding
    PyTorch tensor memory addresses to the engine's inputs and outputs, which is highly
    efficient for GPU operations.
