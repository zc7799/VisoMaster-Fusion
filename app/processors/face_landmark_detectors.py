    Detects if the 5 keypoints form a degenerate geometry (extreme profile or severe pitch)
    that would cause a 5-point affine warp matrix to collapse or produce distorted "monster" faces.

    EVOLUTION & VIDEO OPTIMIZATION:
    Earlier versions relied on rigid thresholds or triangle areas, which failed because AI models
    often "hallucinate" occluded eyes on profiles. This version uses a Continuous Elliptical
    Deformation Energy model based on the nose's deviation from the face's central axis.
    Tolerances are deliberately relaxed to prevent temporal flickering (jitter) during video
    playback. It only triggers a fallback to bounding-box on absolute worst-case scenarios.

    HOW TO TUNE TOLERANCES:
    Do NOT change the `> 1.0` cutoff (it represents the exact boundary of the safe 3D sphere).
    Instead, adjust the `tol_` variables:
      - tol_x (Yaw): Increase to allow more extreme side-profiles before fallback.
      - tol_y (Pitch UP, dev_y_raw < 0): Increase to allow the head to tilt further back
        (nose crossing the eye line) before fallback.
      - tol_y (Pitch DOWN, dev_y_raw >= 0): Increase to allow the head to tilt further forward
        (nose dropping below the mouth) before fallback.
