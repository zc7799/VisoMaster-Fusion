### **Prerequisites**
- Portable Version: No pre-requirements - Minimum Nvidia driver version: >=576.57
- Non-Portable Version:
    -   **Git** ([Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
    -   **Miniconda** ([Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download))
        <br> or
    -   **uv** ([Installation choices])(https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

## **Installation Guide (VisoMaster-Fusion)**

### **Portable version**

Download only the Run_Portable.bat file from this repo (you don't need to clone the whole repo) from link below and put it in a new directory were you want to run VisoMaster from. Then just execute the bat file to run VisoMaster. Portable dependencies will be installed on the first run to portable-files directory.
- [Download - Start_Portable.bat](Start_Portable.bat)

You don't need any other steps from below for the portable version. Always start visomaster with Start_Portable.bat

### **Non-Portable - Installation Steps**

**1. Clone the Repository**
Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
```sh
git clone <URL_TO_YOUR_VISOMASTER_FUSION_REPO>
```
```sh
cd VisoMaster
```
```sh
git checkout fusion
```

**2. Create and Activate a python Environment (Skip if you already have one)**


#### In case you like to use "anaconda"

```sh
conda create -n visomaster python=3.11 -y
```
```sh
conda activate visomaster
```
```sh
pip install uv
```

### In case you like to use "uv" directly

```sh
uv venv --python 3.11
```
```sh
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**3. Install requirements**
```
uv pip install -r requirements_cu129.txt
```

**4. Download required models**
```sh
python download_models.py
```

**5. Run the Application**

Once everything is set up, start the application:
- by opening the **Start.bat** file (for Windows)
or
Activate conda or uv environment in a terminal in the visomaster directory:

```
# If you use Anaconda
conda activate visomaster

# If you use uv only
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Start visomaster
python main.py
```


**5.1 Update to latest code state**
```sh
cd VisoMaster
git pull
```

---

**6. Install ffmpeg**

In Windows - Either via:

- powershell command: "winget install -e --id Gyan.FFmpeg --version 7.1.1"

<br>or

- Download ffmpeg zip: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/packages/ffmpeg-7.1.1-essentials_build.zip
- Unzip it somewhere
- Add "\<unzipped ffmpeg path>\bin" folder to your Windows environment PATH variable

## How to use the Job Manager
1.  Set up your workspace as you normally would before recording (select source/target faces, adjust settings, etc.).
2.  In the Job Manager widget, click the **"Save Job"** button.
3.  Give your job a name. You can also choose whether to use this name for the final output file.
4.  The job will appear in the list. Set up more jobs if you wish.
5.  To process, select one or more jobs and click **"Process Selected"**, or click **"Process All"** to run the entire queue.
6.  Processing will begin automatically. A pop-up will notify you when all jobs are complete.

## Development

- Please use pre-commit before doing git add & commit. And fix found issues before the commit.

  ```
  # Install pre-commit
  uv pip install pre-commit

  # Usage before commits - (run twice in case of found auto corrections)
  pre-commit run --all-files
  ```

### Unit Tests

The project has a test suite covering core pipeline logic (VR math, face masks, face detectors, serialization, job validation, widget logic). Tests run without a GPU and without Qt installed.

**Setup (one-time)**

```sh
# Create a lightweight test venv (separate from the main app venv)
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv-test
.venv-test\Scripts\activate

# Install test dependencies
uv pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
uv pip install numpy scipy scikit-image opencv-python pillow pytest pytest-mock
```

> If you already have a `.venv` with the full `requirements_cu129.txt` installed, you can run tests directly in it — the GPU packages don't interfere.

**Running the tests**

```sh
# Activate your venv first, then:
python -m pytest                  # run the full suite (206 tests, ~2s)
python -m pytest tests/unit/      # unit tests only
python -m pytest tests/integration/  # integration tests only
python -m pytest -k "vr"          # filter by keyword
python -m pytest -v               # verbose output
```

**Test structure**

```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── helpers/      # ParametersDict, miscellaneous utils, VR math, thumbnails
│   ├── processors/   # Face detectors, masks, swappers, frame worker VR flow
│   ├── ui/           # Settings layout schema, save/load actions, job manager, widget logic
│   └── utils/        # faceutil math
