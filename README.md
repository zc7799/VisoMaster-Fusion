# VisoMaster Fusion

VisoMaster Fusion is a desktop application for AI-powered face swapping, enhancement, and editing on images, videos, and live webcam feeds. It combines a polished graphical workflow with advanced model controls, batch processing, VR180 support, and GPU-accelerated inference.

The project builds on the original VisoMaster work by **@argenspin** and **@Alucard24**, plus major contributions from the wider community.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Most users should use the portable launcher:

1. Create a new folder where you want VisoMaster Fusion to live.
2. Download **only** `Start_Portable.bat` from latest release.
3. Put `Start_Portable.bat` in the new folder and run it.

The first launch downloads the portable runtime, dependencies, FFmpeg, and model files. After setup, always start VisoMaster Fusion with `Start_Portable.bat`.

## 🎛️ Feature Highlights

### 🧑 Face Swapping & Editing

- Multiple swapper models, including Inswapper128, InStyleSwapper variants, SimSwap, GhostFace, CSCS, and DeepFaceLive DFM models.
- Multi-face workflows with source face cards, saved embeddings, similarity thresholding, and optional ByteTrack tracking.
- Face likeness, keypoint replacement, face adjustment, expression editing, and pose/expression controls.
- Image, video, webcam, and virtual camera workflows.

### 🎨 Masks, Restoration & Enhancement

- Occlusion, XSeg, text, face parser, border, profile-angle, and mouth-focused mask controls.
- Face restorers, a second restorer pass, auto restore blending, GFPGAN-1024 support, and frame enhancers.
- ReF-LDM Denoiser with single-step and DDIM modes at multiple pipeline points.
- AutoColor, ending color transfer, texture transfer, differencing, MPEG artifact simulation, Restore Eyes, Restore Mouth, and Mouth Fit & Align.

### 🎬 Video, Jobs & Output

- Timeline markers for saving per-frame settings and record start/end segments.
- Issue scanning and dropped-frame review tools for checking render-sensitive frames before output.
- Job Manager for saving workspaces, loading jobs, and running batches unattended.
- Output controls for images, videos, multi-segment renders, audio handling, quality settings, and FFmpeg options.

### 🛠️ Launcher & Maintenance

- Portable launcher with update, repair, dependency check, model check, model optimization, model restore, launcher self-update, and version rollback tools.
- Providers include CUDA, TensorRT, TensorRT-Engine, and CPU, with TensorRT as the default.
- Built-in themes include True-Dark, OLED-Black, Windows11-Dark, Dark, Dark-Blue, Light, Solarized, Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox, and Monokai.

## 💻 System Requirements

- **Operating system:** Windows 10 or Windows 11, 64-bit
- **GPU:** Nvidia GPU recommended
- **VRAM:** 6 GB minimum for basic use; 8-12 GB or more recommended for heavier workflows
- **Driver:** Nvidia driver `>=576.57` recommended for CUDA 12.9 support
- **Internet:** Required on first run to download dependencies and models
- **Disk space:** 20-30 GB free space recommended

The app can run on CPU, but AI processing is much slower. Most users should use the portable version unless they specifically want a manual development setup.

## 📦 Installation

### 🚀 Portable Version

Download **only** the portable launcher from the release page:

- [Download - Start_Portable.bat](https://github.com/VisoMasterFusion/VisoMaster-Fusion/releases/latest/download/Start_Portable.bat)

Place it in a new folder and run it. The launcher installs everything into that folder, including Python 3.12, Git, FFmpeg, PyTorch, CUDA Toolkit , TensorRT, cuDNN, ONNX Runtime GPU, and the required model files.

**You do not need any of the non-portable steps below for the portable version.**

### 🧰 Non-Portable Installation

Use this path only if you want to manage the Python environment yourself.

**1. Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VisoMasterFusion/VisoMaster-Fusion
cd VisoMaster-Fusion
```

Most users should use the `main` branch. The `dev` branch contains newer or in-progress changes.

**2. Create and activate a Python environment**

Using Anaconda:

```sh
conda create -n visomaster python=3.12 -y
conda activate visomaster
pip install uv
```

Using uv directly:

```sh
uv venv --python 3.12
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**3. Install requirements**

```sh
uv pip install -r requirements_cu13.txt
```

**4. Download required models**

```sh
python download_models.py
```

**5. Install FFmpeg**

On Windows, either:

- Run: `winget install -e --id Gyan.FFmpeg --version 7.1.1`
- Or download https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/packages/ffmpeg-7.1.1-essentials_build.zip, unzip it, and add `\<unzipped ffmpeg path>\bin` to your Windows `PATH`

**6. Run the application**

Open `Start.bat` on Windows, or activate your environment in a terminal inside the `VisoMaster-Fusion` directory and run:

```sh
python main.py
```

To update a non-portable checkout:

```sh
git pull
uv pip install -r requirements_cu13.txt
python download_models.py
```

## 📖 More Documentation

- For a practical first-run guide, see [Quick Start Guide](./docs/quickstart.md).
- For detailed workflows, settings, and feature coverage, see [User Manual](./docs/user_manual.md).

## 🧪 Development

Please use pre-commit before `git add` and commit, and fix any issues it reports.

Future releases use PR label-based versioning based on Semantic Versioning.

```sh
uv pip install pre-commit
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### ✅ Unit Tests

The project has a test suite covering core pipeline logic such as VR math, face masks, face detectors, serialization, job validation, recording, scan tools, and widget logic. Tests run without a GPU and without Qt installed.

**Setup**

```sh
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv-test
.venv-test\Scripts\activate
uv pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
uv pip install numpy scipy scikit-image opencv-python pillow pytest pytest-mock
```

If you already have a `.venv` with the full `requirements_cu13.txt` installed, you can run tests directly in it.

**Run tests**

```sh
python -m pytest                     # run the full suite
python -m pytest tests/unit/         # unit tests only
python -m pytest tests/integration/  # integration tests only
python -m pytest -k "vr"             # filter by keyword
python -m pytest -v                  # verbose output
python -m pytest -vv                 # show each test
```

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

- If you see CUDA or provider errors, update your Nvidia driver and restart the app.
- If models are missing, run the launcher model check or `python download_models.py`.
- If portable setup fails partway through, run `Start_Portable.bat` again from the same folder.
